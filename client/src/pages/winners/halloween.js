          <p className="story-para">Rikki was on her way home from the Collage of Synergetics. It was late night and no stars could be sighted on the sky. For some reason it spooked her, she wanted to get home more quickly, to the safety with her security golems. </p>
          <p className="story-para">She forced herself to laugh, breaking the silent of the night, why did she spook herself? However the young asura anxiously begun walking a bit faster. Suddenly her ears became pointed, she could vaguely hear something getting closer extremely fast. </p>
          <p className="story-para">Afraid, Rikki jumped behind the closest corner and hid. However it never came. Pleasantly surprised, Rikki stood up and turned around, preparing to continue her walk home. </p>
          <p className="story-para">“Aaah!” Rikki shouted extremely frightened when she suddenly saw a ghost. She quickly cowered, hoping that it would go away. </p>
          <p className="story-para">“Did I scare you?” Rikki could hear a slightly arrogant voice, Slizzi’s voice to be exact. </p>
          <p className="story-para">She stopped cowering and turned around to look. Behind the miniature metal ghost stood Slizzi with crossed arms, smiling a bit arrogantly. </p>
          <p className="story-para">“You did.” Rikki admitted, with tears brimming in the corner of her eyes. Ashamed of the fact she had become frightened. </p>
          <p className="story-para">Looking at Rikki in front of her trying  not to cry, was difficult. Slizzi quickly showed her a warm smile. She didn’t want to scare her that much. </p>
          <p className="story-para">“This is my robotic ghost 2.0 and if you became frightened then the field test is officially completed.” </p>
          <p className="story-para">“2.0 Was there ever a 1.0?” Rikki asked curiously.</p>
          <p className="story-para">“... There was.” Admitted Slizzi but a little quietly. </p>
          <p className="story-para">“However it ended up as a metal clump at the work bench.” </p>
          <p className="story-para">Rikki truly tried not to laugh but looking at Slizzi’s hesitant expression she couldn’t help it. Soon the young asura burst out laughing. Slizzi stunned by the recent development also begun laughing. </p>
          <p className="story-para">Together the two asuras giggled in the dark, breaking the silence of the spooky night.</p>
